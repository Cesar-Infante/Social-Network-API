# Social Network API

For this challenge creating social network API endpoints using MongoDB and Mongoose was definitely interesting but seeing the correlation with MySQL made it understandable! 
Building out models, and controllers, and modularizing the routes even further has helped to see the whole process of a backend application and how they work together.

to test this application the user can utilize their desired API testing tools some popular ones are Insomnia or Postman, to send various HTTP requests to the server, which will modify the MongoDB database! Check out the video demo for a demonstration of how it is done.
